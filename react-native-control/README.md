## 🌈 Applying Fonts in your application

You already have the font loaded in your application, now you can apply the font in your application.

Add the font name in the `gluestack.config.js` file in the `fonts` object.

```javascript
fonts: {
  heading: "inter",
  body: "inter",
  mono: "monospace",
},
```

## 📖 Documentation

For a deep dive into the components, structure, and configurations, please refer to our [detailed documentation](https://ui.gluestack.io/docs/getting-started/installation).

## 🧪 Testing

We've set up Jest as the testing framework for this project to ensure the reliability of your codebase. You can run the tests using the following commands:

### Setting Up Jest with Expo

To install `jest-expo` in your project, run the following command:

```bash
npx expo install jest-expo jest
```

### Writing Test Cases

To write your own test cases, refer to the [Expo documentation on unit testing](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/unit-testing/) for comprehensive guidance and best practices.

### Running Tests

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

We've added an example of a Jest snapshot test case for the `SplashScreen` component. This test case uses Jest's `jest.mock` to mock a dependency and then renders the `SplashScreen` component within a `StyledProvider`. Finally, it asserts that the rendered component matches the previously saved snapshot.

You can add more test cases as needed for your other components and features. This section serves as a starting point for incorporating testing into your project using Jest.
